Activity-1
1. Create two 2GB GPT partition each on /dev/sdb of type linux 
2. Format above created partitions to create xfs filesystems
3. Add a new partition that is 512MB in size
4. Run partbrobe to make kernel aware of partition table changes
5. Create /backup mount point
6. Determine UUID of /dev/sdb1 and use UUID to establish persistent mount on /backup
7. Mount /backup and verify if the mount is success.
8. Create a mount point /logs and mount the same on 512MB partition which is created earlier.
9. The above command fails, as you have not created filesystem. Now create an xfs filesystem on 512MB partition
   and retry step 8 to mount, which will succeed. Do not add /etc/fstab entry.
8. Reboot the system and check if the mount is available
9. Observe /backup is mounted and /logs was not mounted as /logs entry doesnt exits in /etc/fstab
10.Verify all the mounts in the system using mount command.

Activity-2
1. Do the clean up of the activity-1
   a) unmount all the filesystems
   b) remove entries of respected filesystems from /etc/fstab
   c) remove mount points
   d) remove partitons
   e) observe lsblk doesnt show any partitions
2. Use MBR scheme of partitioning for the below activity. If you have gdisk signature, used dd command to clean up
3. create three primary partitions eac 512MB in size. Crate xfs filesytems and make persistent mount with UUID. Say mount point name are /green, /red, blue
4. create 2 more partitons with 120MB each, and mount those on /white and /yellow. Make entries in /etc/fstab accordingly.
5. create 5 more partitions with 256MB each, and mount them on /chem /phy /math /comp /stat 
6. Reboot the server and verify your mount. Verify with mount command as well.
